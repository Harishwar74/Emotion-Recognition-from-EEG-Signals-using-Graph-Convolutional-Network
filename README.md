# Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

## Overview  
This project focuses on **EEG-based emotion recognition** using a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** with a **Trainable Adjacency Relation (TAR) module**. The model dynamically learns relationships between EEG channels to improve emotion classification accuracy.  

## Features  
- Implements **TARDGCN (Trainable Adjacency Relation Driven GCN)** for **EEG-based emotion classification**.  
- Uses **DEAP dataset** for training and evaluation.  
- Extracts **spatial-spectral features** using the **Welch method** for enhanced feature representation.  
- Achieves **74.13% accuracy on the DEAP dataset**, demonstrating **state-of-the-art performance** in EEG-based affective computing.  

## Dataset
